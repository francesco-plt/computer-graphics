# Computer Graphics

## Introduction

* `assignments`: it contains the solution to all the assignments given during the course, complete with `.pdf` description of the problem.
* `project`: it will contain the code of the final project.
* `utils`: miscellanea which I found useful while completing the assignments.

## Setup

To run anything, you need to follow this tutorial: [Development environment - Vulkan Tutorial (vulkan-tutorial.com)](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment). Once you do that, you can `cd` into any folder and run:

`````shell
$ make clean build
`````

Once it's done compiling you can run the executable.

## Todo

- [ ] `A11` works but I do not really understand why;
- [x] Is it necessary to use three threesholds in `A16`? -> Yes
- [x] Is it necessary to edit the main file of `A15` to achieve necessary results?
- [ ] Todo `A18`, `A19` and `A20`;
- [ ] Add project folder as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules);
