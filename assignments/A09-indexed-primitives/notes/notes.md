# Assignment 09 Notes

## Recall on indexed primitives
Indexed primitives are defined by two arrays: the **vertex array**, contains the definitions (the positions) of the different vertices, and the **index array**, which is used to specify triangles in a indirect way.

## Cylinder

Let's start off with the cylinder parametric equation:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x(\theta, h) = x_{0} + r \cos (\theta) \\
y(\theta, h) = y_{0} + h \\
z(\theta, h) = z_{0} + r \sin (\theta)
\end{array}\right.
$$

Where:
* $\theta$ is the angle generated by the $x$ axis and the cylinder base circumference radius. Note that $\theta \in [0, 2*\pi)$.
* $r$ is the circumference radius.
* $h$ is the z-coordinate of the center of the base circumference of the cylinder.
